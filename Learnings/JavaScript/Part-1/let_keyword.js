//use let keyword instead of Char Maximum in this keyword you can decared one varible just one like

let firstName = "Numaan1";
console.log(firstName);
// supposed im use both let let keywords like
// // |let firstName = "Numaan1";|
// // |let firstName = "Numaan2";| it gives you error but instead of just use variable its working correctly. |firstName="numaan" |
